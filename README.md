# Config-Static-Routes

In this lab, I configured static routes to allow PC1 to successfully communicate with PC2. (PING)
What I took away from this is while this could be viable in a LAN environment, it would be more difficult in a WAN environment as there would be more devices and more manual configurations to make.
